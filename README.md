<h1>Invisible Cloak Project</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In the Harry Potter films, a cloak of disappearance is used. This cloak actually allows you to become "invisible."

In our case, the cloak of disappearance will be used to conceal objects or objects in the space of a video camera.

The software actually receives a live video, knows how to identify the background in the video, and as soon as you place the cloak of disappearance on one of the objects in space or on one of the people, the cloak will cause that object to disappear and become part of the background of the video in real time.

The software makes primary use of the CV2 library, and implements a mask.
